API PROJECT
Background
We were given a weekend to create our own api. I decided to work with express to create the server and utilized knex to connect javascript to the database. The contents of the database include one table that contains basic zodiac data.
Set Up
This is a personal preference, but found it extremely useful downloading insomnia and using it easily check queries made to the database. You will want to run "yarn start" to set up the node and "yarn dev" to set nodemon to keep a pulse on the server.
"https://insomnia.rest/download/#mac" Download Insomnia
Functionality
List queries "/zodiacs", Get queries "/zodiacs/:name", Create queries "/zodiacs" + pass through JSON {"name":newName}, Delete queries "zodiacs/:name", Post queries "zodiacs/:name" + JSON{"name":newName}
